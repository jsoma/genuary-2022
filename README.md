This year I'll be using GENUARY as an excuse to learn [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), which I don't think I've used since the olden days when it was Processing.

You can find [the prompts here](https://genuary.art/prompts) and of course [my awful projects here](https://jsoma.github.io/genuary-2022/). If you'd like to feel the perfect combination of im- and de-pressed [#genuary](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23genuary) on Twitter has plenty to see.
